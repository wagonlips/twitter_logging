[2015-05-25 08:34:24] &lt;wagonlips&gt; (for Fagin Saturday) All hopes are hanged against the walls; in a gloomy yard the prisoners turn the church-clocks; people beat the bars and
[2015-05-23 11:42:18] &lt;wagonlips&gt; spikes. Unmindful speak the staring eyes; people of the knife observe the beaming fruitless faces on the horrors of tremendous times. Silent
[2015-05-22 17:51:36] &lt;wagonlips&gt; fields of orphans knew the rustic words were worked; all the barriers repeat a soft and sacred subject. Unreasonable Grimwig may embrace the
[2015-05-22 17:35:16] &lt;wagonlips&gt; hags and cottagers, but the miserable trinkets satisfy the ever after. Chester's wretched eye remains to die as an illegitimate man supposes
[2015-05-22 15:48:53] &lt;wagonlips&gt; nonsense of some or other. Terrified of proofs and secrets, inquiries and secret searches, babbling their toothless curses, hide the little-

[2015-05-21 18:29:02] &lt;wagonlips&gt; old. Leading up to the tears, I know quite well that, for all they see, I can leave the prison, but joyful agitation is the least we have to
[2015-05-17 14:39:02] &lt;wagonlips&gt; take from boy or man. If officers and others shout with eyes and teeth could they really get out? If heads they capture bravely see, let the
[2015-05-16 12:55:32] &lt;wagonlips&gt; helpless one be me. Heedless as I'll ever be of men who will not lock a knee, I will speak. Now I shout loud. Then I stopped, so bewildered.
[2015-05-15 16:47:54] &lt;wagonlips&gt; If all the days went shuddering by, I would leave to keep but damn and why, to sleep, to think, to stop and let lie, though this may shake a

[2015-05-11 09:39:52] &lt;wagonlips&gt; thoughts that some fraud was repeated in words as fine and wretched as a face: no one was forced and none interrupted; hand by heart by foot
[2015-05-09 09:51:36] &lt;wagonlips&gt; in a life of bricks they walked, a short beginning, till a risk returned them from morning, to twilight, to dusk. She moved along his finger
[2015-05-08 09:56:51] &lt;wagonlips&gt; to lustreless showers, such dreadful, desperate murderers, solitude and atmosphere, but upon the cheerful danger, where the fear should have
