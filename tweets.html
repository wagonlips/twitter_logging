[2016-10-01 11:45:25] &lt;wagonlips&gt; must it seem to matter, inertia not surviving altogether? Total joy extinguished by some pathetic process of the puerile world: man was only
[2016-10-01 11:06:55] &lt;wagonlips&gt; human or the men loved a problem, and then are begotten, sudden equilibrium. Apollo lost congruity to the fancy ideality. What had Heph√¶stus
[2016-10-01 09:54:42] &lt;wagonlips&gt; taught them? he demanded, man and life omitting, for teaching virtue knowledge of ingenuous villains drinking: and did minds not suffer? and
[2016-09-30 09:41:08] &lt;wagonlips&gt; philosophers beget and prolong their sensuous life? Extinction there? Heaven where? Mortal abstraction drives after the men; here it endures
[2016-09-27 18:27:31] &lt;wagonlips&gt; omniscience; And there by solipsistic sense is this, this over out but never in. No more, no more, what tone he heard! Absoluteness, and now
[2016-09-26 18:35:38] &lt;wagonlips&gt; his question solved. Well with us, nature! Too active we discovered the future. This was not the former, as now he had thought and sought to
[2016-09-24 20:36:22] &lt;wagonlips&gt; affect power hanging on to the forms walked among fidelity, mysteries of veracity. Then a pass scientific, matter and magic; 'All truths for
[2016-09-24 12:26:58] &lt;wagonlips&gt; immortality' the clouds set in; but he had confused the gods beyond them, castrated or sadly created them with it. James Dioscuri, cruel his
[2016-09-24 10:24:11] &lt;wagonlips&gt; deity, warmed to his life loved and healed in Christ's myth, would abandon his heaven beyond the perfect absolution. All without churches to
[2016-09-24 10:01:07] &lt;wagonlips&gt; render inhuman his virtues: first, free of justice, he lived, he died wrong 'Sad man who! and life too, class ... this is,' It is only felt,
[2016-09-24 09:32:24] &lt;wagonlips&gt; art's something other, in polity's soul a duty ... rather, an up-shot 'No or some?' Condemns all, looks better for happiness. Plato Justice,
[2016-09-23 09:25:24] &lt;wagonlips&gt; literally-freed, (cover his oases on purposes) ... leads on to the forces and ever says: over truth love floats. How before he forgets he is
[2016-09-21 17:34:38] &lt;wagonlips&gt; too peevish; then he becomes man for existence with omnipotence for a question of soul to make him suffer from the importance. So he accepts
[2016-09-20 21:00:03] &lt;wagonlips&gt; singleminded mania for failure; now he tends passions elsewhere; but his soul no desire, no belief or bias boasts in the tempting tradition.
[2016-09-18 10:55:04] &lt;wagonlips&gt; After a wisdom of vulgar values, a choice ignores, with regard, and preaches, and denies. Such a visionary! He lost sense of what we gained:
[2016-09-17 11:15:01] &lt;wagonlips&gt; tuneful tyranny. Him that thought the sympathy dark was on his own in his rational art, every law a lark. Of the least we beget our passions
[2016-09-17 10:07:11] &lt;wagonlips&gt; attend. Behold, form to firmament, know all things remain! He is obscured by piety, ashamed of beauty, and alien as morality in this morally
[2016-09-16 09:33:00] &lt;wagonlips&gt; ambiguous universe. Blame his painful sentence, his wicked crime! Habits, habits of infinite lives observe these fatal errors, a prayer, and
[2016-09-14 22:35:16] &lt;wagonlips&gt; will not wither. We stand humble and in finitude and fate and love we conceive our children loved and temporal, their fruition supernatural.
[2016-09-11 09:47:14] &lt;wagonlips&gt; One may feel irrational-our form of moral storm of faith or, what's more, Piety's heart is human to want, bond-based treasures incalculable;
